===== Dwargon =====
[[+Granzund:Dwargon|link]]
This country has a history of battle and conquest. The first empress of Dwargon conquered the adjacent countries to build the Dwargon that exists today. Later Emperors and Empresses even attempted to conquer the Dragons that are their neighbors to the northwest and the undead that live in the northeast. Currently, Doar'tz is the reigning god in the region, edging out Ord due to the reigning leadership. The current Emperor is Invincible Overlord Thuuren.
The dominant races in this region are dwarves, minotaurs, void elves (avari), thri-kreen, and mind-flayers (illithid). North of Dwargon there are wastes that are not governed by Dwargon as the kingdom does not wish to expend the resources necessary to control the dragons and swathes of undead that control the two wastes.

===== Nazura =====
[[+Nagano Ocean:Nazura|link]]
Nazura is ruled by a feudal system where ones respect and honor is everything. There are several clans that fight for the right to rule and server the emperor. The emperor of Nazura is a figurehead and the most powerful clan is the one that is able to act through the emperor.
The dominant races this region are the genasi and the yuan-ti.

===== Fairafax =====
[[+Tharosa Ocean:Fairafax|link]]
A war-faring nation, but not by choice. The peoples of fairafax are bred for war to keep the sea at bay. Ever since the creation of the malestrom, the creatures of the deep started appearing near the underwater cities that were once peaceful havens for those weissfolk. After hundreds of years battling these sea-demons, the weissfolk have become quite proficient at waging war. They do not wish to conquer the surface-dwellers, but simply wish to be left alone in their waters. They are very suspicious of any that wish to enter their waters, but it is not unheard of for a tortle or triton to leave and explore the surface-world.
The dominant races in this region are the tortles, merpeople, and the triton.

===== Asharia =====
[[+Granzund:Asharia|link]]
Asharia is a metropolitan soup of races. All peoples of the south banded together in one republic to defend against Dwargon. While less feudal than Nazura, most regions of Asharia still subscribe to some feudal code where the rich protect the poor and the poor pay taxes to the rich. In the south of Asharia exists The Wode. The Wode is a forest where the fey is too close to the material plane. Where the planes overlap creatures seem feytouched and foreign. There exists a paladin order called "The Green" that protects Asharia from the expansion and invasion of The Wode.
The races that exist in large numbers in Asharia are too numerous to count. The races that are prominent enough to control a Barony are: Aarakocra, Dragonborn, Elves, Goliaths, Humans, and Orcs.

===== Uluin =====
[[+Uluin Maelstrom|link]]
A malestrom, frozen at the center, seemingly both in time and in temperature. In the eye exists a portal to The Beneath, the plane ruled by Doar'tz, where creatures of negative energy run rampant and where illithids, drow, duergar, svirfneblin, and yuan-ti all live comfortably. Not much is known about the portal or the surrounding miles of swirling ice as explorers that go near it have the propensity to never return.
