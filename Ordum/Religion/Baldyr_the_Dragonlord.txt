Finally, Baldyr created Dragons in their image, making them knowledgable in all Baldyr deemed useful as well as giving each dragon a portion of their power. Dragons then went on to use the power that Baldyr bestowed upon them to further create the Dragonborn and several other minor races such as the kobolds and lizardfolk.
Baldyr presides over magic and fire and is called upon by those that wish to use it. Baldyr also presides over the knowledge that every sentient creature possesses.
Baldyr resides in and rules Doomfire, the burning lands.
Baldyr's chosen weapons are the heavy pick or simply a creature's bite and their symbol is the circling dragon. Badlyr's color is red.
