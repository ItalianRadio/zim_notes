Razalak was bored with the idea of adding creations to a new plane of existence and instead wished to sample the new denizens of the plane. Descendants of Razalak that show certain demonic attributes are known as Tieflings. Finally, Razalak after realizing that there just weren't enough creatures that were inherently sinful created some nice sinful creatures that would worship them in the goblinoids.
Razalak presides over those that wish to commit sin without remorse and is called upon to grant their blessing to those that travel this path. Warriors pray to Razalak for good fortune in war and assassins do the same before they perform their job. Razalak is also the god to pray to if you wish to have a new start at life. Razalak may simply require their souls when they die as recompense, for others he simply requests that they enjoy themselves. It all depends on how they are feeling.
Razalak resides in and rules the Nine Hells.
Razalak's chosen weapons are the glaive and garrote and their symbol is the crooked blade.
