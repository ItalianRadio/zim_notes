Created Tuesday 28 May 2019

* Saint of Ambition
* Male
* Mountain Dwarf

As the first Invincible Overlord of Dwargon, Dwar made his country what it is today. Establishing dwarves as the true leaders of Dwargon and making all others subservient to him. He created the floating city that he eponomously named and himself chained it to the groun. Dwar is the Saint of Ambition and leads those that have grand schemes of power and those that wish to rule.
