Nyce created the flora and fauna of the world, adding all the non-magical creatures and plants. They are responsible for the forests of the world and all the plants and animals that the layfolk eat on a daily basis. Finally, Nyce created the Elves in their image, making them lithe like the forests and as fiercly protective of the forests and creatures inside them as Nyce themself. They also created the Orcs in their image, for they are as chaotic as nature itself, going where they will and doing what they want, for they are strong like the forest and as stubborn as nature.
Nyce presides over forest-dwellers and those living off the land without injuring it. Nyce also presides over those who protect that which they believe in.
Nyce resides in and rules the Seeth.
Nyce's chosen weapons are the shortbowand rapier and their symbol is called moon and sun. Nyce's color is green.
