When Primus finally deigned to look upon the new land that the others had created they were appalled. This new land had no laws and the creatures were running about with no purpose. They thought, "How can a being bear existing without a purpose?" Primus then attempted to changed everything on Ordum in an attempt to make everything make sense. In an attempt to give everything a purpose. This angered all the other gods, as they had put their souls into this new land and this god dared to change that which they believed was as perfect as it could be. Because of the actions that Primus performed, the gods agreed not to directly influence this plane as to not destroy that which the others had created. Instead, they were to act through their most devout followers, their saints. Primus decided that since this inadvertently gave every being a purpose that they could live with this change. Finally, he created the thri-kreen and gave them the ability to work together like a well-oiled machine.
Primus presides over those that will follow the law. For without law, society just leads to chaos and death of everything you love. Primus simply asks their followers to follow the law. Primus also presides over souls that perish. They loathe any souls that would escape them and hate it when the undead revive from their graves.
Primus resides in and rules Mechanus, the mechanical plane.
Primus's chosen weapons are the crossbow and club and their symbol is the cross of law.
