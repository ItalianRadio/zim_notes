====== Asharia ======
Created Tuesday 28 May 2019

Human/Dragonborn/Elf/Orc/Halfling/Gnome/Tiefling

A country created out of necessity, not want, the people of Asharia came together to defend against the invasion coming in from the north. By the time Asharia was created more than half of what now constitutes Asharia was taken by the Dwargon. The people came together and fought back, with the orcs and aarakocra attacking in way that the Dwargon had never seen before. After pushing back their foes and erecting a massive wall, the Asharians created something of a republic. While the south had had an emperor for a while, it was mostly just a title to respect. Ord gave the title to a wiseman, not originally of this plane and he chose to simply wait. After the war was over, the wiseman gave titles to all the peoples of Asharia. The wiseman realized there was a limitation on his blood magic and that he was only capable of dispensing eight titles when he had but two remaining, running out when it came to the orcs, lizardfolk, dragonborn, and goliaths. The goliaths and dragonborn came together saying that they would share a title that only the strongest amongst them would take and the lizardfolk saying the same with the orcs. Then the wiseman gave up the title of emperor to a young dragonborn named Zamghund. Zamghund declared that the kingdom would be a Republic and that he merely existed to arbitrate its function. Since then the emperors of Asharia have acted as such, intervening only to break ties and occasionally to eliminate corruption in Asharia's ranks.

===== Bedaghar Barony =====
Traditionally ruled by humans, the Barony of Bedaghar is dominated by forests and the small towns interspersed in them. The Barony is mostly one of farming, logging, and trade as it houses the largest trading port in Asharia. Whenever the war with Dwargon wanes, the Barony of Garmund issues a declaration of intent and the two Baronies go to war, and thus, Bedaghar has a large standing army, just in case. In the Barony, there lives a hugely influential Wizard that has lived in his tower for hundreds if not thousands of years. The Barons of Bedaghar has traditionally asked for his wisdom whenever they find themselves in a bind. Additionally, while the man seems to habitually cloister himself in Chourst Tower, he will leave to seek out those who he believes are in need of his teachings, gathering them into his tower and giving them jobs so that they can live without the problems that previously plagued their lives.
While humans are the overwhelming majority in this barony, it is not uncommon to find all other races in the minority here in Bedaghar. Elves and gnomes live unhindered in the forests, Aarakocra do their trading in the capitol city, Tahnlund. In Tahnlund you will find any race under the sun, even occasionally seeing renegade Dwargon vessels that have come to trade their wares from the Dragon Wastes with Dwarves and Minotaurs on them. Genasi are a common sight here, but upon leaving the town's borders you will rarely find one in Bedaghar.

===== Garmund Barony =====
Known to some as the Dark Plains, Garmund Barony is ruled by a fierce family of warriors. While they all serve Asharia as its shield they hold no loyalty to each other and have been traditionally raised to be cutthroat and merciless. When the reigning baron passes away, they declare and heir and though this should decide who is next to rule it is usually decided with honorable combat if the heirs are willing, and through assassination and trickery if there are less honorable descendants amongst the heirs. Consumed by the necessity of manning the wall and supplying troops for the war, Garmund Barony is composed almost entirely of soldiers and the towns that spring up to support and sell to them. Even the port town of Resk exists to trade with the warlike people of Fairafax so both war-like cultures can share their military advances. When the war to the north subsides the Baron of Garmund will often look to the fertile lands of the south that could further be used to feed and supply their army. No crown, only a throne represents the barony.

===== Talroc Barony =====
Talroc Barony is called home by those that either have been living there for ages, or those that have no other choice. A land constantly under siege from the creatures of The Wode, Talroc Barony's peoples are tough and a scarce few aren't jaded. Home to a large number of people whose ancestors were pushed out of their homes, Talroc Barony will exist as long as the Order of the Green will continue to defend them. The capital of Talroc is extremely heterogeneous, with no race holding a clear majority amongst the population. That trend continues throughout the barony, with most settlements holding a large swathe of races. The only exception is the small villages of wood elves that are happier living in the wilderness, nearer to the wode than those that choose to live in a city's walls.
In Talroc, there exists a town of gnomes that worship Baldyr fanatically. They are known as the Shade and they built the town Deepshade. There they practice and create magics unheard of to the outside world.
Talroc contains the port of Othea, a city whose purpose seems to be to mine the unmelting ice vortex that surrounds the Uluin Malestrom.

===== Skrai Barony =====
Aarakocra & kenku

===== Estral Barony =====
Mostly high elves, other elves allowed, no other races typically allowed passed the border town.

===== Dracovalk Barony =====
Dragonborn in the plains, Goliaths in the mountains

Orcs in the swamp, Lizardfolk on the coast

===== Capitol Barony =====
Simply called Capitol by most, it is the center of government in Asharia.
