Known to some as the Dark Plains, Garmund Barony is ruled by a fierce family of warriors. While they all serve Asharia as its shield they hold no loyalty to each other and have been traditionally raised to be cutthroat and merciless. When the reigning baron passes away, they declare and heir and though this should decide who is next to rule it is usually decided with honorable combat if the heirs are willing, and through assassination and trickery if there are less honorable descendants amongst the heirs. Consumed by the necessity of manning the wall and supplying troops for the war, Garmund Barony is composed almost entirely of soldiers and the towns that spring up to support and sell to them. Even the port town of Resk exists to trade with the warlike people of Fairafax so both war-like cultures can share their military advances. When the war to the north subsides the Baron of Garmund will often look to the fertile lands of the south that could further be used to feed and supply their army. No crown, only a throne represents the barony.
