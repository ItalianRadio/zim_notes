====== Bedaghar Barony ======
Created Tuesday 28 May 2019

Human/Halfling

Traditionally ruled by humans, the Barony of Bedaghar is dominated by forests and the small towns interspersed in them. The Barony is mostly one of farming, logging, and trade as it houses the largest trading port in Asharia. Whenever the war with Dwargon wanes, the Barony of Garmund issues a declaration of intent and the two Baronies go to war, and thus, Bedaghar has a large standing army, just in case. In the Barony, there lives a hugely influential Wizard that has lived in his tower for hundreds if not thousands of years. The Barons of Bedaghar has traditionally asked for his wisdom whenever they find themselves in a bind. Additionally, while the man seems to habitually cloister himself in Chourst Tower, he will leave to seek out those who he believes are in need of his teachings, gathering them into his tower and giving them jobs so that they can live without the problems that previously plagued their lives.
While humans are the overwhelming majority in this barony, it is not uncommon to find all other races in the minority here in Bedaghar. Elves and gnomes live unhindered in the forests, Aarakocra do their trading in the capitol city, Tahnlund. In Tahnlund you will find any race under the sun, even occasionally seeing renegade Dwargon vessels that have come to trade their wares from the Dragon Wastes with Dwarves and Minotaurs on them. Genasi are a common sight here, but upon leaving the town's borders you will rarely find one in Bedaghar.
