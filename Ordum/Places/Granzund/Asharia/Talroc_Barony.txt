====== Talroc Barony ======
Created Tuesday 28 May 2019

Human/Halfling/Gnome

Talroc Barony is called home by those that either have been living there for ages, or those that have no other choice. A land constantly under siege from the creatures of The Wode, Talroc Barony's peoples are tough and a scarce few aren't jaded. Home to a large number of people whose ancestors were pushed out of their homes, Talroc Barony will exist as long as the Order of the Green will continue to defend them. The capital of Talroc is extremely heterogeneous, with no race holding a clear majority amongst the population. That trend continues throughout the barony, with most settlements holding a large swathe of races. The only exception is the small villages of wood elves that are happier living in the wilderness, nearer to the wode than those that choose to live in a city's walls.
In Talroc, there exists a town of gnomes that worship Baldyr fanatically. They are known as the Shade and they built the town Deepshade. There they practice and create magics unheard of to the outside world.
Talroc contains the port of Othea, a city whose purpose seems to be to mine the unmelting ice vortex that surrounds the Uluin Malestrom.
