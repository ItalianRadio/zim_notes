====== Half-Elves ======
Created Tuesday 28 May 2019 - [[ordum:People|back]]

The half-brethren of elves, they are not really accepted anywhere as the elves' xenophobic traits tend to find them too human to keep around while the humans find them too elf-like to be trustworthy. They tend to find their homes in orders of knights, the army of Asharia or Dwargon, mercenary groups, or in cults where their race means nothing to those surrounding them.

===== Drow Heritage =====
Usually born of the human slaves drow keep and their war-like mothers, those half-elves with drow heritage are raised to be living sacrifices to Doar'tz. They are raised with such devotion to Doar'tz that it is extremely uncommon for one to break the brainwashing that they receive and live a normal life outside the Deep.

===== Eladrin Heritage =====
Half-elves with the eldarin heritage, otherwise known as a half-elf with keen senses, is uncommon only due to the fact that eladrin themselves are uncommon. Less hated than normal by their elven brethren, half-elves with eldarin heritage usually find themselves living with their eladrin family, not outcasts, but instead just another person with an unfortunately short life and a "cute" penchant to be ambitious. The eladrin pray to Ord to protect their half-elf cousins from their ambition.

===== High Elf Heritage =====
Hated by their high-elf cousins and distrusted by their human cousins, a half-elf of high elf heritage is your quintessential half-elf.

===== Human Heritage =====
Sharing most similarities with those half-elves with high elf heritage, those half-elves with human heritage, otherwise known as a half-elf with skill versatility, can sometimes live among humans. As they look more human-like than most half-elves, some half-elves with human heritage hide away their elven features, sometimes even notching their elven ears, so that they can live amongst humans living normal lives.

===== Sea Elf Heritage =====
A half-elf with sea elf heritage is welcomed by those weiss-folk as a brother-in-arms against their opponents that dwell in the depths of the ocean. Thou they are still distrusted by their sea elf cousins.

===== Wood Elf Heritage =====
Merely distrusted by both wood elves and humans, a half-elf with wood elf heritage simply lives its life distrusted by all cousins, but loved by other races as a creature that is "the best of both worlds."
