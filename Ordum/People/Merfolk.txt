====== Merfolk ======
Created Tuesday 28 May 2019 - [[ordum:People|back]]

Rarely seen by surface-dwellers, the merfolk spend most of their lives supporting, supplying, and fighting for their defense force. They are soley responsible for keeping the creatures of the deep at bay.

==== Towns of Coral ====
Underwater merfolk towns are built into coral reefs. The merfolk construct them by growing coral into specific dwellings and then living in them once the growth is complete. They will often hire a druid to grow them a house if they have not the time to grow their own house.

==== Warriors of Magic and Water ====
Merfolk have no qualms with any kind of magic or martial tradition. If it can be used to fight the denizens of the deep ocean, then the merfolk welcome it with open arms. Traditionally, merfolk have leaned toward the more arcane, becoming wizards more often than not. They tend to stick to this vocation, leaving the divine to their tortle brethren and the martial focused traditions to the tritons.
