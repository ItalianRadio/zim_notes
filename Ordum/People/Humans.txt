Humans are the dominant race in most of northwest Asharia, ruling the province of Bedaghar ancestrally. You will be able to find them in nearly all reaches of Ordum, from Nazura to Fairafax Humans have proved their worth as a hard-working, dedicated, ambitious race.

==== Slaves to the North ====
If you find a human in the country of Dwargon they are either a slave or one powerful enough to kill any that come to make them a slave.

==== Rulers of the Golden Coast ====
As rulers of Bedaghar humans control the mightiest trading port in all of Asharia, this massive city on the coast of Bedaghar may not be the capital of the barony, but it is the largest and most important city. The baron allows the city council to set its own rules and taxes, though they have historically demanded a minimum tax rate, and thus the port city has prospered, trading with all of Nazura, gathering resources and fey tools from the Wode via the southern port town, as well as trading with the more rebellious coastal cities of Dwargon.
