====== Firbolgs ======
Created Tuesday 28 May 2019 - [[ordum:People|back]]

Firbolgs are born forest protectors, created by Nyce to protect and safeguard her creations.

==== Southern Hospitality ====
The majority of firbolgs live in the forests that surround the Wode. Their ancestors began to live in these lands to protect both the natural forests from the Wode and to prevent innocents from venturing into the Wode.

==== Defenders of the North ====
Those firbolgs that make their homes in the north are staunch defenders of their forests. Protecting them from the invading undead and the fearsome shadar-kai they will go to any lengths to protect their forest dwellings from the attacking forces that make their homes in and near Saur.
