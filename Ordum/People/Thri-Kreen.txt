====== Thri-Kreen ======
Created Tuesday 28 May 2019 - [[ordum:People|back]]

Thri-Kreen are the insect people of the desert. As they are born without the necessary mouth-parts to speak any language but their own, they are notoriously hard to communicate and trade with. Living in their massive underground desert cities, no one outside their culture truly knows what they get up to in the middle of their massive desert. The one exception is the gladiatorial arenas built on the outskirts of every Thri-Kreen city, these small arenas build up their own little sub-cities surrounding them so that anyone that can survive the journey can enjoy the matches.

==== Slave Keepers ====
The Thri-Kreen wander their desert looking for those about to perish and snap them up, feeding, watering, and caring for them until they are able to stand on their own. Once they are able to work, they are enslaved, performing manual labor or participating in the gladiatorial arena. As the Thri-Kreen have been barred from taking dwarven slaves by the Invincible Overlord, they have gotten around this by breeding their dwarven slave stock with humans, creating the mul, a race heartier than humans, and yet not entirely dwarf.
