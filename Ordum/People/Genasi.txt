====== Genasi ======
Created Tuesday 28 May 2019 - [[ordum:People|back]]

Originally minor elementals of their home planes, the genasi are the result of humans being infused with energies from the more elemental planes. Their constant worship of the gods of the four elements causes their homeland to have a much more elemental prescence than the rest of the world.

==== Feudal Society ====
The genasi have a very feudal society where respect and face means nearly everything to them. To disrespect someone is to start war. To trust someone is to let them into your family. If a Nazuran says that they trust you, then they have let you into their inner circle, you are family to them and they will do anything you ask, but they expect the same from you.

==== Rules of Engagement ====
The genasi are constantly at war with one another, but to maintain the balance of power with the other countries, they follow certain rules of war. Only the Barons and Emperor know all the rules, but even the layfolk know that the war must not reach the villagers. That there will be no burning and pillaging of a conquered town and that the new ruler will keep them safe from harm.

==== True Meaning of War ====
The Emperor allows the great war simply because they have believed for generations that the war keeps their people sharp. When Dwargon came across the great ocean to invade, the Nazurans not only repelled the grand army, they destroyed it. Ever since then, the emperor has decided that their people should wage war to achieve their favor and that the victors should reign over their people.

==== Adopted Those in Need ====
The genasi are very empathic to those in need. When the yuan-ti cam to them attempting to escape the grand exile to the Deep, the genasi bathed them in elemental magics, cleansing them of Doar'tz's corruption and allowing them to live more normal lives. Now the yuan-ti live amongst the genasi and are treated as equals so long as they follow the rules of Nazuran society.

==== No True Division ====
The genasi realized that they are one true race when they saw that their children were not necessarily genasi of the same elements as their parents. As such, it is not uncommon to see temples to The Four instead of temples to Ralu, Ord, Baldyr, and Weiss. Additionally, a genasi's element is never seen as something to discriminate against or something to sole judge someone by.

==== Named By the Gods ====
While there are no real lines of separation amongst genasi, they still acknowledge their elements, thanking the God that oversees their fate. They go by the following names:
* Air Genasi: Rali
* Earth Genasi: Oriot
* Fire Genasi: Baldyran
* Water Genasi: Weissish

==== Weaponsmiths and Boatbuilders ====
The Nazurans trade in the most skillfully created weapons in the world. To wield a Nazuran sword is to wield the best blade you have ever touched.
Similarly, a Nazuran-built boat will last a helmsman his life, his child's life, and at the very least his grandchild's life.
