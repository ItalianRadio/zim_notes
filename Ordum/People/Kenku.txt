====== Kenku ======
Created Tuesday 28 May 2019 - [[ordum:People|back]]

Once creatures of the sky, they are now cursed to live their lives on the ground. Most kenku resent their aaracokra cousins and have moved to urban areas, living their lives as theives and owners of shops of curios and baubles. There are still those that remain living in the only major aarakocra city of Skree'awk, making money by living as silent merchants amongst their flying cousins.

==== Speechless ====
Kenku will mainly talk using thieves' cant, using the sign language as their main form of communication. They have evolved thieves' cant beyond its initial usage as something to simply talk in the open with to a real sign language that may integrate whistling and clicks for more specific descriptions. To a simple user of thieves' cant a kenku speaking will make that user feel inadequate and they might only understand two thirds of the words used. Kenku are not proud of their mimicry of others, preferring only to use it when necessary either to trick and confuse others or when absolutely necessary to get communication across to someone important.

==== Need to Fly ====
While usually silent about this want, Kenku share a collective desire to fly, either by magic or not. They want to be able to fly under their own power, but if offered a flying carpet or a magical flying broomstick, they'll accept the items with glee. The opportunity to mount and steer a flying beast also greatly appeals to them.
