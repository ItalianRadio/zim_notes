====== Aarakocra ======
Created Tuesday 28 May 2019 - [[ordum:People|back]]

The aarakocra long ago carved their cave network out of the mountain in the southwest of [[Places:Granzund:Asharia|Asharia]]. Preferring to stay in the skies, the aarakocra tend only to leave their lands for trade and to send troops to the on-going war with Dwargon.

==== Culture of War ====
All aarakocra train for war even if only the elite wage it. Every morning, the people of Skrai take to the skies to train themselves. This means that any attack on Skrai will be met with brutal vengeance and that few may survive the onslaught of the flying nation.

==== A Nation of Flight ====
Aarakocra traditionally hate roosting on the ground and as such have built a massive colony into the mountains of Skrai. They don't have interior tunnels, instead preferring to fly from room to room and house to house. Most aarakocran homes don't even have exterior doors, locking their valuables away inside their rooms.

==== Self-Made ====
Aarakocrans take great pride in their workmanship. Each home being dug by the family that once lived there and their furniture being inherited or made, never sold to other aarakocra. While there are aarakocran artisans, they usually sell to the kenku who peddle their wares outside of Skrai, where aarakocran workmanship is a valued commodity for the rich.

==== Justice Demands Retribution ====
Aarakocra believe in a brutal system of justice, an eye for an eye, tooth for tooth. In this system a theif will have a hand taken for theft, a cheat will lose an eye, a liar loses their tongue. Aarakocra will not delay justice and it is the responsibility of everyone to mete it out when a crime occurs.

==== Playing an Aarakocra ====
A player wishing to play an aarakocra must acknowledge their racial hatred for living so close to the ground. While nearly all aarakocra gravitate to the more martial classes a player could find reason to play any class as an aarakocra.
