====== Yuan-ti ======
Created Tuesday 28 May 2019 - [[ordum:People|back]]

Humans corrupted into snake-abominations by Doar'tz. Nearly all yuan-ti have been exiled to the Deep. Those who escaped exile managed to flee to Nazura, there the influence of Baldyr, Weiss, Ord, and Ralu was so strong that they managed to escape the clutches of Doar'tz.

==== Feared by Many ====
Yuan-ti that live in Asharia are feared and shunned, thus a yuan-ti might find ways to hide their heritage and appear human to those around them.

==== Accepted by The Four ====
Yuan-ti that ran to Nazura are proud worshippers of the gods that saved them. They will either worship the four or pick one to be devoted to in thanks for their salvation in Nazura.

==== The Spiders of the Emperor ====
While you will find yuan-ti in all but two of the clans in Nazura, one of the major clans that directly serve the emperor, the Spider Clan, are proud of their yuan-ti heritage and their usefulness to the emperor. Only those in the Spider Clan know of the missions they are asked to take, but all Nazurans know that the Spider Clan is an important resource to the emperor and not to get in their way as they will do anything to serve their newfound purpose.
