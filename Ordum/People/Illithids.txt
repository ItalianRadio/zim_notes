====== Illithids ======
Created Tuesday 28 May 2019 - [[ordum:People|back]]

Creatures born in the Deep. They have come to the material plane to assist in the domination of Ordum by the Dwargon. They were given a mountain range to live in and they have made the Dwarves' ancient abandon mines into their home.

==== Slave creators ====
Over the millenia the illithid have come to the material plane and abducted many creatures, bringing them back to the Deep and enslaving them. In the case of some abducted elves, they had be abducted for millenia, so long in fact that they changed from their original form to the gith.

==== Subordinate, Not Subservient ====
While the illithid obey the commands of their god, Doar'tz, they are more like Doart'z's subordinates rather than their worshippers. They interact with Doar'tz on a much closer basis and as such they look up to Doar'tz as more of a living hero rather than an unreachable idol. Due to their constant interaction with their god, the illithid are often considered confusing and nebulous by other races. They always have a goal in mind and it's not always obvious what they're trying to accomplish.
