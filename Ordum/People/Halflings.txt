====== Halflings ======
Created Tuesday 28 May 2019 - [[ordum:People|back]]

Found everywhere in Asharia, halflings build their settlements anywhere they can farm comfortably. Though they traditionally live in little mounds in the hills, they will build houses or reuse housing intended for those larger than them without second thought.

==== Sedentary ====
Halflings, as a race, do not like to leave the land in which they were born. Most would rather buy an adventurer a round at a tavern than experience the journey themselves. That doesn't mean that they shun adventure; They love tales of glory and strife. They just wish to hear them o'er a pint rather than fight the monster themselves. hey don't tend to join the military, instead offering levies of crops to the military so that they will continue to protect their livelihoods. In the bigger cities you will commonly find many halflings as members of the thieves' guild, stealing and even doing the most uncouth jobs found in the city. Although rare, you may find halflings in the military and if you do, be prepared as they can be some of the toughest warriors amongst the bunch.
