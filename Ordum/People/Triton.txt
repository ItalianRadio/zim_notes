====== Triton ======
Created Tuesday 28 May 2019 - [[ordum:People|back]]

A proud people that live in ignorance. They live in the belief that the rest of the world appreciates their contribution toward keeping the denizens of the deep ocean at bay with their great martial ardor.

==== Strength Above All ====
The tritons value martial strength above everything. If you can fight with a trident, it matters not to them if you were strong because you enchanted it or if you trained for years to wield it. Thus you will find that all tritons tend to focus on some sort of martial vocation even if their primary focus is on the more arcane, divine, or primal. A bard will belong to the College of Lore while a Wizard will learn from the Cabal of Bladesingers and a warlock will not even know of the existence of any pact boon besides the blade.
