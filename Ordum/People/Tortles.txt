====== Tortles ======
Created Tuesday 28 May 2019 - [[ordum:People|back]]

The nation of Fairafax's diplomatic warriors, due to their "limited" ability to stay submerged and fight against the creatures of the Deep, the tortle have found themselves being the nation's diplomats and caretakers of its more surface-oriented living spaces.

==== Dedicated to Weiss ====
As the waterbound nation's caretakers of their more landbound properties, the tortles have traditionally cared for the nation's temples to Weiss. As such, you will find a grand number of clerics and paladins dedicated to Weiss as well as a large number of warlocks that have made a pact with the god. Raised under the temple's power you will also find a large number of monks that tend to the less religious duties of caretaking for their temples.
