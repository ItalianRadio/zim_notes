A group of farmers, warriors, and sailors, minotaurs are a deeply religious people that hold on to ancient ancestral ties for meaning in life.

==== A Race, Divided ====
Long ago minotaurs divided themselves by religion. Some chose Razalak and other Weiss to follow. This divided them into seafarers and into farmers. The seafarers left Dwargon and traveled the world, trading and engaging in piracy as they saw fit. The farmers became ingratiated into Dwargon, first helping Queen Paloma in her rule, then getting shunned by the Invincible Overlord, and finally being ground down by the Cult of Doar'tz. The two subraces have been apart for so long that anyone can tell the difference at a glance. The followers of Weiss have smaller horns, lither bodies, and are typically more intelligent. The followers of Razalak and Doar'tz are bigger and more intimidating in most every way.

==== Run if by Land, Trade if by Sea ====
While those minotaurs that follow Weiss don't typically settle in Asharia, they can commonly be found in any of the port towns that surround the great nation. They will be conducting trade and meeting and making friends as a friend made now is money made later. They are the only group of people whose ships are allowed to cross through the nation of Fairafax, making trade between their cousins' towns and Asharia possible. On the other hand, the land-bound minotaurs are vicious protectors of what's theirs. It is considered a sworn duty for them to join the grand army supporting Dwargon and when you retire only then shall you pick up sickle and hoe to become a farmer so that you can feed your people and raise strong children.

==== No Divide Amongst Men and Women ====
The clothing the minotaurs wear is made to specifically mask gender, covering their nipples found on their abs. Additionally, the women bear the child for only 4-5 months before birth and recover almost immediately from the whole ordeal. The roles women and men take in society are identical with the only difference being that a women is expected to take three days before and after birthing a child off.
