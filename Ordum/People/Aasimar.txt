====== Aasimar ======
Created Tuesday 28 May 2019 - [[ordum:People|back]]

An aasimar simply looks like a beautiful human at first glance and only those that have seen many a aasimar at war in the past can tell at second glance what they are truly looking at. Aasimar live amongst humans, most of the time not knowing their true heritage until they unlock it at a moment when they show true bravery or betrayal.
