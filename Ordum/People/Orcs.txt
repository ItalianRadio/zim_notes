====== Orcs ======
Created Tuesday 28 May 2019 - [[ordum:People|back]]

Making their home in the swamps of Rhageer, orcs are a tribal, mobile culture. You can find orcs anywhere in Asharia, so long as the environment isn't too arid or if it is, then there is war. Traditional orc names in this campaign are taken or derived from Tolkien's Universe.

=== Rafir, the One ===
One of the five legendary heroes of old, Raphir has ruled the barony of Ragheer for millenia. An orc zealot, Rafir is a faithful worshipper of Saint Whoosh, the Free. Acting as an avatar for Whoosh, Rafir is renowned for his ability to be able to rage and cast spells at the same time.

==== Becoming Uruk ====
Upon reaching their teenage years all orcs wishing to become an 'Uruk', which is just the orc word for orc, must participate in the provings. The provings are a constantly on-going, pausing only for specific days of worship. To enter the provings a young orc must join a warband composed of 5-8 other young orcs. Every four days these warbands must fight and once a warband has proven their might to the proving master they must pass one final test before finally becoming uruk. The leader of the warband must prove their might and will spend a night in the labyrinth with at least one member of the shaman council. The others must fight without their leader against the proving master's 'gijakpis', orcish for bloodthirsty. If both pass, then the warband become uruk and have the right to fight in Asharia's war with Dwargon. The warband will spend the next day celebrating their victory, the day after preparing for their journey, and finally a final day being prepared to greet other cultures by the tribe's shamans and leader. Then they leave to spend at least 5 years at war with their warband. After that, they are free to do whatever they wish. Some live off the land, traveling Asharia, some return home, and finally, some stay on the warfront, continuing the fight with Dwargon.

==== Orcish Slave Culture ====
Orcs treat 'slavery' different from other cultures. Because of this orcs have two words for slave. The first is 'Nan/Nenmundis' and the second is 'Snaga'. A nanmundis is an orc that has lost a 'mundas' or battle of strength to an uruk, or a person that has chosen to live subservient to an uruk. While the orc nanmundis is technically called a slave, this is not a disgraceful title to hold in orc culture and it holds different implications if the orc is an uruk or not as even the title changes. Nanmundis for uruks and nenmundis for non-uruks.

=== Nanmundis and Nenmundis ===
If an uruk is a nanmundis then they are the slave to the other uruk for one year and must only be told to perform duties befitting and uruk like working the uruk's fields should they have them, or performing hard labor in a smithy. The other option if the uruk does not have need of slaves is to command the other uruk to pay them a reasonable amount or perform an embarassing or disgraceful action that is within reason. Additionally, being a nanmundis is treated more as a day job, with the uruk being able to go home after the workday is done and being able to ask for a reasonable amount of time off to perform other duties. An uruk that is currently a nanmundis cannot challenge mundas until they are no longer a nanmundis. Finally, a nanmundis must be payed for time spent being a slave and they must be paid wages that the community deems fair. Most communities have agreed upon rates that one must pay nanmundis's for the various jobs they typically perform.
If a non-uruk is a nenmundis then to outsiders it would probably be considered to be more of a job, with the uruk being the boss. While it is similar, it is more than that. While it is not up to uruks to make sure that their nanmundis are well-cared for, it is up to uruks to make sure that their nenmundis are well taken care of. With each uruk being responsible for their nenmundis's living quarters, food, and their general protection. While it is not required to pay your nenmundis, it is considered to be a sign of a good uruk to pay the especially hard-working nenmundis a fair wage. While nanmundis are decided in battle. A nenmundis must offer to become one. Like being a nanmundis, this isn't considered to be a negative title for non-orcs to have, but is considered to be a negative title for orcs, as becoming a nenmundis is the only alternative for those that cannot pass the provings. These orcs tend to be merchants, dealing with the pesky money that the orcs have little use for in their homeland. As orcs realize that merchants are necessary they aren't looked to poorly upon, but there is still a cultural bias against them.

=== Snaga ===
Snaga are what most outsiders would call slaves. They are worked hard and usually to death. Orcs do not believe in the death penalty and instead put their accused in pits to work the mill or leave them tied-up to a post in the latrine pits. These punishments usually last until death and the bodies are typically tossed into the latrine pits to rot.

==== Orcish Arms ====
The orcs construct their own arms with the metal they pull from the swamp. They gather bacteria from the swamp and smelt it in large quantities creating the black metal tartarite. The orcs make all their arms from tartarite as it does not rust even when crudely smelted and has all other properties of steel. Orcs typically favor two-handed weapons and their orcish black full-plate.
