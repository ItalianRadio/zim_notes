====== Goliaths ======
Created Tuesday 28 May 2019 - [[ordum:People|back]]

Society ruled by their warriors. There exists two kinds of goliaths, the warriors and the chauri. The warriors stand head and shoulders above the chauri, standing at an average of 7'10". They are your typical goliaths. The shodan, or leader of a goliath tribe, is the warrior in charge. He makes the laws and decides who does what. The chauri stand a little taller than your typical human. They advise their warriors and cast blessings upon them. As there are three or four times as many chauri as there are warriors, the chauri find a warrior that will accept them and then they marry. A warrior is expected to have 3 or 4 spouses. If their warrior dies, a chauri comes under the protection of the shodan. All unmarried chauri are under the protection of their warrior parent until their marriage. It is rare to find an unmarried chauri over the age of 20. If you wish to be a chauri, your 'race' benefits will be human, but you will be treated as a goliath in all other ways. Chauri typically become clerics and druids, but are not limited to those classes, it is simply a cultural norm for the protected to become healers and advisors.

==== Chauri and Their Warriors ====
A chauri's duty is to their warrior and them alone. They guide and protect their warrior and their warrior will heed their advice. Goliaths have evolved to become the mouthpieces for their chauri and it is not rare for an inferior warrior to become shodan on the back of a powerful chauri granting their blessing. Both warriors and chauri are made up of both men and women. with an almost even divide amongst genders in both subraces. Additionally, it is not rare for a warrior to be married to a chauri of the same gender. While sometimes they are simply marrying a good friend and advisor, other times they are marrying another lifelong companion.

==== Becoming Baron ====
When competing for the title of baron of Dracovaulk, all the shodans will go to the foot of the mountain with their chauri and compete in a tournament with the dragonborn representatives to become the next baron. This fight is the only time warriors are expected to fight without their chauri's power.
