====== Religion ======
Created Tuesday 28 May 2019

Religion in Ordum is commonplace as the actions of the Gods are seen at least a few times a year during festivals and the like by even the layfolk. The majority of the people in Ordum to be fairly religious, at least in their beliefs, if not in their actions. There are temples of some sort, dedicated to a God or saint in nearly every town in Ordum, while in the rural villages you will still find shrines dedicated to a saint or two.
The Gods of Ordum created everything on this plane of existence together and grant those who give them patronage a certain amount of power. They spend the majority of their time managing their home plane and care little for the matters of the material plane.
The Nine Gods preside over Ordum

===== Saints of Ordum =====
The vast majority of people in Ordum have never had a direct relationship with the gods. Instead they worship their most pious followers, their saints. To become a saint, it is not necessary to be a cleric or paladin to a God or saint, but instead to be true to a tenant that a god prefers in their followers.
Gods have dozens of saints with some saints serving in a subservient capacity to other saints that govern the same traits. If a god payed enough attention to you when you were alive there is a good chance that you will become a saint upon death. The gods are fickle though and easily lose interest in those that live simple lives.
Finally, saints are made after death and even the concept of a living saint is considered sacrilege. If someone were to go around declaring that they are a saint, they might find themselves accused of a major crime, framed in a way where the punishment is death.
